I'm really happy to announce that the first edition of Hands-On Neural Networks with TensorFlow 2.0 is out!

![cover](/images/tf2-nn/cover.png)

The book is divided into 3 parts:

1. **Machine Learning and Neural Networks fundamentals**: an explanation in simple words of the theory that powers many machine learning algorithms, with a focus on neural networks
2. **TensorFlow fundamentals**: the TensorFlow 1.x architecture, the new TensorFlow 2.0 architecture, its new features and ecosystem, and how to transition from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.0
3. **Neural Networks applications**: how to solve problems developing neural networks-based solutions and, at the same time, learn how the new features of the TensorFlow 2.0 ecosystem can help us in every step of the machine learning pipeline; production included.

The book is available on Amazon on three different stores and is available both in paperback and Kindle version!
