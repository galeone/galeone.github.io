Starting from Unreal Engine 5.3, Epic Games added the support for the so called [modern Xcode workflow](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-modern-xcode-in-unreal-engine-5.3-and-newer). This workflow allows the Unreal Build Tool (UBT) to be more consistent with the standard Xcode app projects, and to be compliant with the Apple requirements for distributing applications... In theory! ðŸ˜… In practice this workflow is flawed: both the code signing and the framework supports are not correctly implemented, making the creation of working apps and their distribution impossible.

In this article we'll go trough the problems faced during the packaging, codesigning, and notarization of an Unreal Engine application that includes:

- The CrashReporter: so an additional binary inside our .app.
- The browser widget (so the engine CEF plugin - that is now treated as a macOS/iOS framework).
- A third party library with pre-built libraries ([URedis](https://github.com/Galeontz/URedis)).
- Engine third party libraries (like Intel tbb - that's automatically added in the packaged application).

The problems presented are inside the Engine itself, and we try to fix them from the outside avoiding (when possible!) to modify the engine.

## Creating distribution-signed code for macOS

After creating an Unreal Engine application we, of course, want to distribute it to the world. On macOS we can decide to publish our app to the Mac App Store or to distribute it directly to our users (e.g. making it available for download on our website).

In both cases, we need to create distribution-signed code which is code that's being compiled, signed, packaged, signed once again, and either submitted to the Mac App Store or to the notary service.

One of the promised of the modern Xcode workflow is to simplify the developers' life integrating the steps of compilation, sign and packaging inside the UBT. It will be the UBT itself to invoke Xcode and to perform the signing steps.

### Configure the modern Xcode workflow for code signing

The configuration can be done using the editor itself or - as I recommend - editing the configuration files manually (so we don't have to open the editor that's a slow operation).

The file to configure is the `DefaultEngine.ini` configuration file, in the local `Config` directory. As every unreal developer knows these files are able to overwrite the settings already defined at engine level (settings that we can copy to use as a starting point). `[/Script/MacTargetPlatform.XcodeProjectSettings]` is the section to configure.

```toml
[/Script/MacTargetPlatform.XcodeProjectSettings]
bUseModernXcode=true
bUseAutomaticCodeSigning=true
bMacSignToRunLocally=false
CodeSigningTeam=<TEAM IDENTIFIER>
BundleIdentifier=<APPLICATION IDENTIFIER>
TemplateMacPlist=(FilePath="/Game/Build/Mac/Resources/Info.plist")
PremadeMacEntitlements=(FilePath="/Game/Build/Mac/Resources/entitlements.plist")
ShippingSpecificMacEntitlements=(FilePath="/Game/Build/Mac/Resources/entitlements.plist")
```

- `bUseModernXcode=true`: enables the modern Xcode workflow.
- `bUseAutomaticCodeSigning=true`: enables the code signing using the information specified below.
- `bMacSignToRunLocally=false`: must be set to false to be able to firm with a valid developer ID, and not with the empty id "-".
- `CodeSigningTeam`, and `BundleIdentifier` are the unique identifiers of the Apple Developers (given by apple) and of the application under the same team ID, respectively.
- `TemplateMacPlist` is the soft-path (relative to the `Game` directory, that's where the `.uproject` file is) of the *information property list* (`Info.plist`). This file will be placed inside the application bundle and it contains a set of metadata (in a key-value fashion) used by both the application itself, the operating system, or by the system frameworks (e.g. to facilitate the launch of apps).
- `PremadeMacEntitlements` and `ShippingSpecificMacEntitlements` are the soft-paths of another `.plist` file that can contain other metadata. The file contains the list of rights/privilege that the application requires to run (as we'll see in the [TODO LINK TO SECTION], we need to grant certain privileges to our app to be able to execute the web browser widget without a crash).

To get the `<APPLICATION IDENTIFIER>` and `<TEAM IDENTIFIER>` I redirect the reader to the Unreal Engine documentation about this topic: [Provisioning Profiles and Signing Certificates](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/setting-up-ios-tvos-and-ipados-provisioning-profiles-and-signing-certificates-for-unreal-engine-projects). Please also note that you must login on Xcode using your Apple Developer Account. This is mandatory to correctly start the signing process using Xcode (invoked by the UBT).


### The application

The `Config/DefaultEngine.ini` file is part of very trivial unreal engine application that, as mentioned in the first paragraph of the article, contains a couple of third-party plugins (`URedis` and `WebBrowserWidget`). The full project can be found here: TODO

In the article only the relevant parts for packaging, codesigning, and notarization are shown.
